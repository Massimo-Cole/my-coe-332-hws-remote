A repository for coe332 homework 1. Contains two practice Python scripts, Powers and Even_Odd. 

Powers prints 3 lists side by side seperated by commas, the first list contains all intergers 1 to 10, the second contains the squares of each int in the first list and the thrid contains the cubes of each int in the first list. 

Even_Odd reads a list of ~10 intergers and prints each number followed by "Odd" if the number is odd and "Even" if the number is even.
